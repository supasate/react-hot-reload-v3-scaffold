## React hot reload v3 with react-router v3 and react-router-redux v3 ##

Does hot reload work? **NO**
Does time travel work? **YES**
Can child component access router state with connect? **NO**

Note: redux-router v2.1.2 needs react-router v2.x and history v2.x (does not work with react-router v3 with history v2.x/3.x)
